I have shared some useful links above. But not everybody likes to learn from the same source. Please search on youtube for whatever you want to learn and filter by playlist. There you can select a playlist / video of your liking. Also always remember that Google is your best bet for clearing doubts. 

If you can't figure out a way to learn all these things by yourself using internet, I strongly recommend you not getting into Programming/Developer roles. If you can't figure out basic stuff by your self, I am pretty sure you won't be able to figure out intermediate/advanced stuff either. Learning how to use the internet is a critical skill for a developer. So learn to use the internet (more specifically Google and Youtube) for your basic stuff so you will be ready for bigger stuff.
